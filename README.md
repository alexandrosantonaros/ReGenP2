# ReGenP2
Data Warehouse, Analytics and Visualization

The Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) Cataschevastica Database DB, which has been
designed in the ReGenP1, is used for handling transactional workloads in the
real-time or near real-time environment of the company. In this project, a Data Warehouse (DW)
is designed for analytical purposes. The needs will be analysed, the fact and
dimension tables will be defined, its structure designed, the Extract Load Transformation (ETL)
procedure implemented, analytical calculations performed, visualisations provided and managerial
dashboards produced. For the analysis of data from various factories the data are concentrated in a
delta lake managed by Databricks. Finally, the visual reports and dashboards are designed
using the Power BI Desktop tool.
